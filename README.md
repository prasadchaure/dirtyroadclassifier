# Clean vs Dirty Road Classifier
This project is a TensorFlow-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify images of roads as either "clean" or "dirty". The model has been trained on a dataset of road images and has achieved a training set accuracy of 94.27% and a test set accuracy of 93.75%.

To use the model, simply provide an image of a road and run it through the trained model to obtain its classification. You can also use the pre-trained weights to fine-tune the model for your specific use case.
